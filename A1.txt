CISC/CMPE 457 Assignment 1
Due October 10 at noon

You may work alone or in pairs.  Do not show any of your code to
anybody outside your group.  If you keep code on github, keep it
private so that others cannot see it.

You are to modify an image editor to

  - use backward projection
  - modify pixel intensities with windowing
  - apply local histogram equalization

  See "YOUR CODE HERE" in editor.cpp.

  Change only the code in editor.cpp.


How to run the code

  On Linux or MacOS, use a terminal window and go in to the 'linux' or
  'macos' directory, then execute

    make
    ./editor ../images/pup.png

  or
  
    ./editor ../images/strawberries.png

  You can try other images in the 'images' directory, especially the
  flower and parrot, which have transparent pixels.

  On Windows with Visual Studio 2019, OPEN THE ASSIGNMENT BY
  DOUBLE-CLICKING ON 'editor.vcxproj' IN THE 'windows' FOLDER.

  DO NOT OPEN VISUAL STUDIO FIRST.  VISUAL STUDIO SHOULD BE CLOSED
  WHEN YOU DOUBLE-CLICK ON 'editor.vcxproj'.  DO NOT USE VISUAL STUDIO
  *CODE*.

  In Visual Studio, put the image filename in the project properties
  as a command-line argument in the Debugging section.


In the window

  Select the editing mode by pressing

    S - to scale
    I - to change intensity

  Select the projection mode by pressing
  
    F - for forward projection
    B - for backward projection

  Apply local histogram equalization by pressing

    E - apply equalization
    + - increase equalization radius
    - - decrease equalization radius

  And you can press

    Z - reset everything ("zero")

  After selecting an editing mode, left click the mouse and drag it.

    For scaling, moving the mouse toward or away from the image centre
    will scale the image smaller or larger, respectively.

    For intensity changes, moving the mouse left/right changes the
    intercept of the intensity transform function, but in an intuitive
    way described in the code comments.  Moving the mouse up/down
    changes the slope of the transform.
    
Coding

  First get backword projection working.  Test it with scaling.

  Then get intensity changes working.  This involves (a) editing the
  intensity transform in 'mouseMotion()' and (b) applying the
  transform in 'applyIntensityTransform()'.

     The intensity transform has two parts: an accumulated transform
     from *past* mouse motion, and a recent transform from *current*
     mouse motion, while dragging the mouse.  Once the mouse button is
     released, the current transform is combined with the previously
     accumulated transform to get a *new* accumulated transform in
     'stopMouseMotion()'.

     The slope of the intensity transform function is

        recentIntensityScale * accumulatedIntensityScale

     and the intercept of the intensity transform function is

        recentIntensityBias + accumulatedIntensityBias

     While the mouse is being dragged, your code in 'mouseMotion()'
     should be updating recentIntensityScale and recentIntensityBias
     based on the mouse position with respect to its position when it
     started dragging.  Your code never changes the accumulated
     values.  Those are changed in 'stopMouseMotion()' with the
     existing code.

     The intensity transform is
     
        Y' = Y * slope + intercept

     In the 'applyIntensityTransform()' function, you will have to
     convert RGB to YUV, then change Y to Y' as above, then convert
     back to RGB.

  Finally, implement local histogram equalization in 'histogramEqualization()'.

To Hand In

  Make a directory called 'a1'.  In that directory, put exactly three
  files:

    - editor.cpp
    - editor.h
    - README.txt     with your name(s) and netID(s) and any comment you
                     have for the TA.

  Create a zip archive a1.zip of the a1 directory and submit it to OnQ.

  You will lose marks if you do not follow these submission
  instructions exactly.  You will lose marks if you are in a group of
  two and each person submits the assignment.  These penalties exist
  because not following the instructions makes unnecessary work for
  the TAs.
